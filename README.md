## ts-loader-three
```shell
npm install
webpack // warning
tsc app.ts // works well
```

## three-react-typescript
```shell
npm install
npm start // error
```

I don't know why `THREE.OBJLoader` throws an error in `three-react-typescript` and a warning in `ts-loader-three`(Anyway why?). But I think neither of them are valid.
